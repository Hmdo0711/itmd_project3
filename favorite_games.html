	<h3>Punishing: Gray Raven</h3>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<p><strong><em>Punishing: Gray Raven</em></strong> takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting where humanity has almost been eradicated due to the Punishing Virus, an extremely dangerous virus that infects and takes control of both human mind and machinery, which are called the Corrupted, to attack anything that shows vital life. Survivors are forced to take refuge in a space station called Babylonia, which is their last line of defense as well as their only hope in reclaiming Earth. Humanity develops technology that helps humans resist the virus through turning a minority of them into cyborgs, known as the Constructs. In the game, you are the squad commander of a team named Gray Raven consisting of elite Constructs in a grand mission to find a clue and suppress the Punishing Virus.</p>

	<p>This game is the top on my list because of its unique combat mechanic that is fast-paced and heavily skill-based. The characcter designs are detailed with cool artstyle, actual character development, and godlike gameplay animation (seriously way too good). The story is heavy,  has good depth and can be really emotional. The BGM are bangers that elevates the gameplay experience considerabily. Not to mention the chibi characters are super adorable.

	<p> This game has wide variety of character with each having completely diferent playstyles, making it extremely fun to clash with other player in a contest purely base on skill and to show how much you have master a certain character. Both me and my brother enjoy this game a lot (he's really good and often bully me so I had to sneak practice behind his back to get revenge, and I did)
